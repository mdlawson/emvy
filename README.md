emvy
====

A tiny MVVM framework built with coffeescript.

Emvy's main goals:

* Dont make a mess: not in your objects, not in your DOM. emvy stays out of all your stuff as much as it possibly can.
* Minimize magic, but still be elegent: Emvy aims to make sure your code is easy to follow, but tries to keep the common stuff short.
* No dependencies: jQuery is great, and using emvy with jQuery is probably a good idea. However, the core of emvy wont ever use jQuery. This helps keep things fast and light
* Be fast. Not using jQuery in the core should help keep emvy blazing quick.

Emvy is still in the very early stages of construction.
