Emvy&#39;s main goals are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t make a mess: Not in your objects, not in your DOM. emvy makes heavy use of closures to store its internal state, rather than sprinkling it everywhere.</li>
<li>Minimize magic, but still be concise and elegant. emvy aims to make code execution reasonably transparent and easy to follow, even to someone unfamiliar with emvy&#39;s structure and concepts.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t decide your stack for you: emvy doesn&#39;t care what templating you use. emvy pays attention to your data attributes so it can seamlessly swap in new data, but no further. emvy doesn&#39;t care if you use jQuery, Zepto, underscore, lodash, whatever. Using a few other utilities is probably a good idea, but emvy has no dependencies.</li>
<li>emvy has no default store implementation. Thats right, you&#39;ll have to make your own. emvy provides a trivial API to interact with, and a reference localstorage implementation that uses depot.js</li>
</ul>
<p>emvy does however, encourage a few design ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>MVVM: Standing for Model, View, ViewModel, MVVM is similar to MVC but uses data binding to connect models with views. emvy&#39;s ViewModel (and ViewCollection) are very thin, merely ferrying events around.</li>
<li>Hierarchical views. emvy helps build hierarchical view systems, and then passes events up and down the chain easily. emvy&#39;s view system is quite similar to the DOM it represents, but abstracts it into data.</li>
<li>Composition over inheritance: emvy&#39;s design is focused around components: functions that extend objects with further functionality. emvy suggests that recurring ideas be expressed in this way in your applications as well. This helps encapsulate functionality away from data. </li>
<li>Thin routing - The router isn&#39;t at the top in emvy&#39;s design. Its just another source of events. </li>
</ul>
